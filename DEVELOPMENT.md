# Development & Testing Guide

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 18+ | Runtime (client build tooling) |
| pnpm | 9+ | Monorepo package manager |
| Bun | 1.0+ | Server runtime and test runner |
| Rust | stable | Prover core simulation (`services/prover/core/`) |
| wasm-pack | 0.12+ | Compile Rust sim to WASM (`services/prover/wasm/`) |
| Stellar CLI | latest | Contract interaction (optional, for on-chain features) |

## Local Setup

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Stellar-Playvores/ProofStrike.git && cd ProofStrike
pnpm install
```

### 2. Build WASM simulation

The Rust fixed-point simulation must be compiled to WASM before the server or client can run. This is required after any change to `services/prover/core/` or `services/prover/wasm/`.

```bash
pnpm build:wasm
```

This runs `wasm-pack build --target web` inside `services/prover/wasm/`.

### 3. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your values. Required for basic local development:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | No | Server port (default 3000) |
| `STELLAR_ADMIN_SECRET` | For ranked/on-chain | Stellar secret key for match registration |
| `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` | For ranked/on-chain | Soroban RPC endpoint |
| `PROOFSTRIKE_CONTRACT` | For ranked/on-chain | Deployed game contract address |
| `VITE_ACCOUNT_WASM_HASH` | For passkey wallets | Smart Account Kit WASM hash |
| `VITE_WEBAUTHN_VERIFIER` | For passkey wallets | WebAuthn verifier contract |
| `VITE_RELAYER_URL` | For passkey wallets | OZ Channels relayer URL |
| `WORKER_API_KEY` | For proof workers | API key for remote proof worker auth |
| `BOUNDLESS_RPC_URL` | For Boundless proving | Base mainnet RPC |
| `BOUNDLESS_PRIVATE_KEY` | For Boundless proving | Ethereum private key |
| `PINATA_JWT` | For IPFS pinning | Pinata API token |
| `RISC0_DEV_MODE` | For dev | Set to `1` for instant fake proofs |

For casual-only local development, only `PORT` is needed (or just use the default).

### 4. Start the server

```bash
bun services/server/src/index.ts
# or
pnpm start
```

For auto-reload during development:

```bash
pnpm dev:server
# runs: bun --watch src/index.ts
```

The server listens on port 3000 (HTTP + WebSocket). SQLite database is created automatically at `services/server/data/proofstrike.db`.

### 5. Start the client dev server

```bash
pnpm dev:client
```

This starts Vite at `http://localhost:5173` with HMR. The client connects to the game server WebSocket.

## Project Structure

```
ProofStrike/
  packages/sim/        -- TS game types/constants (legacy sim, types still used for rendering)
  apps/client/         -- Phaser 2D client (Vite + TypeScript)
  services/server/     -- Bun game server (HTTP + WebSocket + SQLite)
  services/prover/
    core/              -- Rust fixed-point simulation (single source of truth)
    wasm/              -- wasm-bindgen wrapper over core
    guest/             -- RISC Zero zkVM guest program
    host/              -- Proof orchestration (local + Boundless)
  contracts/proofstrike/  -- Soroban smart contract
```

## Running Tests

## Deployment

Deployment targets three production servers (US, EU, Asia). See `CLAUDE.md` for full infrastructure details.

### Using deploy script (Linux/modern bash only)

```bash
# Deploy server to all regions
./scripts/deploy.sh server

# Deploy to specific region
./scripts/deploy.sh server eu
```

Requires `declare -A` (bash 4+). Always commit and push before deploying.

### Manual deployment (macOS)

macOS ships bash 3.2 which does not support `declare -A`. Deploy manually:

```bash
# Build client
cd apps/client && npx vite build && cd ../..

# Copy to each server
scp -r apps/client/dist/* root@178.156.244.26:/root/proofstrike/services/server/public/   # US
scp -r apps/client/dist/* root@89.167.92.60:/root/proofstrike/services/server/public/      # EU
scp -r apps/client/dist/* root@5.223.61.107:/root/proofstrike/services/server/public/      # Asia
```

Static file changes do not require a server restart. For server code changes, SSH in and restart the Bun process.

## Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, Bun test runner, ESLint + Prettier
- **Rust**: Fixed-point i32 with 8 fractional bits (256 = 1.0), `step_mut(&mut State)` for zero-copy mutation
- **Test runner**: Bun (`bun:test`) for all TypeScript tests
- **WASM is the source of truth**: The Rust sim in `services/prover/core/` is compiled to WASM for client and server, and to RISC-V for the ZK prover. The TS sim in `packages/sim/` is legacy (types and constants still used, but `step()` is not called).
